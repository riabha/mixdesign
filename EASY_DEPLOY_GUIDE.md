## Method 3: Quick Command Line (If you want to try)

Since I just installed Vercel CLI for you, you can try:

### Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\conc
vercel login
```

This will open your browser to login. Then run:
```powershell
vercel --prod
```

**BUT honestly, Method 1 (Drag & Drop) is MUCH easier!**
