## 📤 Part 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. 

### Copy YOUR repository URL (it will look like):
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/concrete-mix-design-quest.git
```

### Then run these commands in PowerShell:

**I'll prepare them for you! Just copy-paste after you create the repo:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\conc

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main
```

**REPLACE:**
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `REPO_NAME` with your repository name

---

## 🎯 Quick Example:

If your GitHub username is `drriaz` and repo name is `concrete-mix-design`:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/drriaz/concrete-mix-design.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted, and DONE! ✨
