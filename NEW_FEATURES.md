## üîß Technical Improvements

### Concrete Type Detection Algorithm

**Detection Logic:**
1. **Check for UHPC:**
   - Strength ‚â•60 MPa
   - W/C ‚â§0.35
   - Has silica fume
   - Has superplasticizer

2. **Check for SCC:**
   - Slump ‚â•200mm
   - Has VMA
   - Has superplasticizer
   - Placement = SCC

3. **Check for HPC:**
   - Strength ‚â•40 MPa
   - W/C ‚â§0.40
   - Has superplasticizer

4. **Check for Mass Concrete:**
   - Total SCM ‚â•50%
   - Strength ‚â§35 MPa

5. **Default to Normal:**
   - Everything else

### W/C Ratio Calculation

**Auto Mode Formula:**
```javascript
// From strength (Abram's Law approximation)
W/C = 0.5 / (1 + (target_strength - 20) / 80)

// Then apply exposure limit
final_W/C = max(calculated_W/C, exposure_max_W/C)
```

**Manual Mode:**
```javascript
// Use user-specified value directly
final_W/C = user_input_value
```
